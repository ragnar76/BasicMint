# BasicMint
BasicMint is (kind of) a fork of VanillaMint. It is based on VanillaMint
from Joska (https://atari.joska.no/VanillaMiNT/). It's goal is to create a
very small and basic FreeMiNT (https://github.com/freemint/freemint) setup for the Firebee
(http://firebee.org/fb-bin/index).

# Licence
I don't know what license Joska has chosen but i'm fine with GNU GPL V3.
