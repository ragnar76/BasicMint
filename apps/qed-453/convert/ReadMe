
 convert.app
 ===========

This little program converts old parameter files (default.qed 
until version 3.98 beta) into the new file format (qed.cfg) of 
version 4.0.  The new format is human readable (and writable), 
yet you should edit it with care.

After converting default.qed you should start qed once with the 
new qed.cfg and save your configuration in order to remove 
errors that have slipped into the file during conversion.
