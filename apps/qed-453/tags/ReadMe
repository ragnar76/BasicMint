
 tagfiles for qed

A tag must not contain more than 8 characters.
After pressing the ESC key in qed the text in front of the equals-sign (`=') 
will be expanded to the text behind the equals-sign. All characters from `=' 
to end of line will be included.
If an asterisk (`*') appears in front of `=' the tag will be expanded
automatically (without pressing ESC prior to the input of the tag) as
soon as it is typed in in qed.
An optional tilde character (`~') inside the expanded text specifies the
cursor position after the expansion took place. With no tilde, the cursor 
will be placed right behind the expanded text.
The string `^^^' inside the expanded text will be replaced by a
linefeed. This allows you to create multi-line tags.
